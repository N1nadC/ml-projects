# üíì Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning

## üìå Project Objective
The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that can accurately predict whether a person is likely to have heart disease based on various medical and personal attributes. Early detection of heart disease is crucial for timely intervention and treatment.

## üß† Problem Statement
Heart disease is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. Predicting the presence of heart disease in a patient can significantly aid healthcare providers in diagnosis and treatment planning. This project leverages supervised learning to classify whether a person has heart disease (1) or not (0).

## üìä Dataset Description
The dataset used contains various medical attributes of patients. Below are the key features:

| Feature      | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| `age`        | Age of the patient |
| `sex`        | Gender (1 = male, 0 = female) |
| `cp`         | Chest pain type (0‚Äì3) |
| `trestbps`   | Resting blood pressure (mm Hg) |
| `chol`       | Serum cholesterol in mg/dl |
| `fbs`        | Fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl (1 = true; 0 = false) |
| `restecg`    | Resting electrocardiographic results |
| `thalach`    | Maximum heart rate achieved |
| `exang`      | Exercise-induced angina (1 = yes; 0 = no) |
| `oldpeak`    | ST depression induced by exercise |
| `slope`      | Slope of the peak exercise ST segment |
| `ca`         | Number of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy (0‚Äì3) |
| `thal`       | Thalassemia (1 = normal, 2 = fixed defect, 3 = reversible defect) |
| `target`     | Target variable (0 = no heart disease, 1 = heart disease) |

## üöÄ Workflow
1. **Data Collection** ‚Äì Dataset from open-source repositories (Kaggle / UCI).
2. **Data Preprocessing** ‚Äì Handling missing values, categorical encoding, feature scaling.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** ‚Äì Understanding data distribution and feature relationships.
4. **Model Building** ‚Äì Logistic Regression used as the base classifier.
5. **Model Evaluation** ‚Äì Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, Classification Report, ROC-AUC curve.
