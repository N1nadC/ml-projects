# Fake News Detection System 📰❌✅

This project is a Machine Learning-based Fake News Detection System that uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to classify news headlines as **real** or **fake**. The system uses a CountVectorizer and a Passive Aggressive Classifier for efficient binary classification.

## 📌 Project Overview

Fake news has become a significant challenge in the digital age. The goal of this project is to build a simple yet effective system that can classify news statements as true or false using machine learning.

### ✅ Features

- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Text vectorization using `CountVectorizer`
- Classification using `PassiveAggressiveClassifier`
- Model evaluation using accuracy and confusion matrix
- Interactive detection possible via Streamlit (optional extension)
